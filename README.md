# Adeva Frontend Task

## Getting Started

- Run `yarn && yarn start` to install all dependencies and start the application.
- Go to [home](http://localhost:8081) to get started.
- Run `Yarn jest` to run the tests
  NOTE: there is a bug at DraftJS (used to create a wyswig for note editing) which causes nots note to presist due to convertion error at the lib.
  I worked alot on solving it but it took me two days and I still didn't find a solution so I decided to submit the task.
